## What is Arch?
Arch Linux is a minimalist, independently developed Linux distribution for x86-64 systems, following a rolling-release model. 
It's designed for users who prefer to build their system from the ground up, offering a minimal base environment and a package manager, `pacman`, for managing software. 

Arch Linux is inspired by CRUX, another minimalist distro, but was built from scratch. 
It's known for its simplicity, flexibility, and the community's extensive documentation and support.

It has one of the largest software repositories available - via the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org), a community-driven software repo that hosts build instructions for various software.

## How to use Arch in StratOS
**Nothing** needs to be done! StratOS is an Arch-based distribution that *layers* Bedrock Linux on top of the existing Arch `stratum`.
All packages (Arch/AUR packages) are *completely* supported on StratOS.
