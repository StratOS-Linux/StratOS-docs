## What is Fedora?
Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the Fedora Project, initially created in 2003 as a continuation of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux project.
It's known for being on the leading edge of open-source technologies, offering software under various free and open-source licenses. 
Fedora is the upstream source for CentOS Stream and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with new versions released every six months. 
It's available in multiple editions, including personal computer, server, cloud computing, containerization, and Internet of Things (IoT), catering to a wide range of users from developers to system administrators. 
Fedora is popular for its stability, ease of use, and extensive community support, making it a favorite among both beginners and advanced users.
