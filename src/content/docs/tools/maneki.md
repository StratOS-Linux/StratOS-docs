## What is it???
The _StratOS Maneki Neko_ is our simple Welcome screen application. It opens up automatically after you login into your newly installed StratOS system.

## What does it do?

This small program is made to fulfill just these three things.


> Tell you about StratOS, how its made and what exactly it is.

> Tell you about the StratOS community and the contributing members to the project.

> To help set up your new system by providing easy access to do the initial setup process including (but not limited to - in future versions) the following tasks:
>> Installing a new StratOS distro (aka `stratum`) easily.\
>> Changing common default settings such as default apps and/or themes.\
>> Installing from a community-curated list of popular Linux applications.
>>

New users can make use of _Maneki Neko_ to install popular applications on an otherwise barebones system which may require prior Linux command knowledge.
